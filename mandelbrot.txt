Mandelbrot Set:

z = a + bi
z^2 = (a+bi)(a+bi) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bi

The set of complex numbers for which the recurrence relationship
Z_i+1 = (Z_i)^2 + C does not diverage
Z_0 = C
Z_1 = (Z_0) ^2 + C
Z_2 = (Z_1) ^2 + C...

So a complex number c is a member of the mandelbrot set, if |Z_n| does not diverge,
after applying the iteration repeatedly and starting from Z_0 = 0. (where n>0)

if a point is outside the circle radius 2 about the origin, it will diverge

The mandelbrot set is usually coloured, depending on how many iterations the point takes for it to diverage
